# Robotics_NavStrategies
This project is part of the Robotics course from Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. 

The main goal of this project is to implement a navigation strategy so that the Pioneer-3DX robot is able to follow a reference trajectory, evaluating if there is any opened, semi-opened or closed door. 

In order to control the robot tracjectory, we will be using the Laser Range Finder (LRF) to evaluate the distance between the robot and the wall and the depth between the wall and the door in order to evaluate the state of the door.
